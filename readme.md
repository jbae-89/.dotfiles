# Readme

This is a small readme to keep track of what I may envision the future of my nix
systems will look like, keep track of issues or remind myself of small details.

## Todo
- Add configs for other computers
- Split configs into sensible architecture
    - common & specific configs
- Possibly change DE

## Issues
- All systems operating correctly.
